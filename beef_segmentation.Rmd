# Data Cleaning

First we load the packages we will use for this analysis.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2, here, readxl, janitor, modelsummary, kableExtra, cluster, factoextra)
```

The dataset for this case study is from the CIAT - International Center for Tropical Agriculture downloaded from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FMGTQF). The data comes from a survey questionnaire administered to 354 randomly selected meat consumers in Cali, Popayan, and in the municipalities of Mercaderes and Patia in Colombia. 

```{r}
beef <- read.csv(here("data", "beef_consumerdata.csv")) %>%
  clean_names()
```
